# Welcome to Path to Safety!

You are a community of researchers racing to develop a strong AI alignment strategy before super-intelligent AI is developed.

### Game Objective

There are four strategies, "Governance", "Agent Foundations", "Pivotal Act", and "Prosaic Alignment". Each of these strategies has a hidden
difficulty between 1 and 13. You need your progress in one of the strategies to be higher than its difficulty at the end of the game to win.
Each strategy has a progress counter next to it that you use to track your progress toward that strategy. You can play cards each turn that
can help increase your progress or reveal more information about the strategy difficulty. However, at the end of each round, you will need
to roll the Mad Science dice, which will end the game if you get a bad roll! Work together to complete a strategy before time runs out!

### Game Flow

Have all players join the room and then click the "New Game" button to start a new game. Each player will take a turn in numerical order,
and then the round will end and a new round will start (See "At the End of the Round"). Keep playing rounds until the game ends. You can
choose to end the game voluntarily at any time if you want, but generally you would only do this if you are sure you will win if you do so.

### On Your Turn

First, draw a card (See "Drawing Cards"). Then take one of the following actions:

#### Research:

Play a research card (See "Playing Research Cards"). If the strategy of the research card you played matches the strategy of the card
beneath it in the discard pile, then gain momentum (See "Gaining Momentum").

---

#### Publish:

Play an innovation card (See "Playing Innovation Cards"). If the strategy of the innovation card you played matches the strategy of the card
beneath it in the discard pile, then gain momentum (See "Gaining Momentum").

#### Conference:

Discard a card from your hand, and all other players draw a card. You do not advance Mad Science if you draw a Mad Science card from a
Conference, instead simply discard the Mad Science card and draw a new card.

### At the End of the Round

First, roll all of the Mad Science dice. If the "1 x continue" indicator is showing and none of the dice are showing the "x" symbol, the
game ends (See "Ending the Game"). If the "1 ✓ end" indicator is showing and any of the dice are showing the "✓" symbol, the game ends (See
"Ending the Game"). Then advance Mad Science (See "Advancing Mad Science").

---

### Drawing Cards

When you draw a card, reveal the top card of the Science deck. If it is a Mad Science card, immediately discard that card and advance Mad
Science (See "Advancing Mad Science"). Otherwise, put that card into your hand. Repeat this process until you have added a non-Mad-Science
card to your hand.

### Playing Research Cards

When you play a research card, discard it from your hand into the Science discard pile. Then reveal the top card of the strategy deck
indicated by the research card you discarded, moving the revealed strategy card to the appropriate revealed cards zone. Then roll the
Acceleration Risk die. If the number shown on the Acceleration Risk die is equal to or lower than the Acceleration Risk value shown on the
card, advance Mad Science. (You don't actually need to roll the die if the Acceleration Risk level is zero since this can't advance Mad
Science)

---

### Playing Innovation Cards

When you play an innovation card, discard it from your hand into the Science discard pile. Then increase your progress level by one in the
strategy indicated by the card.

### Gaining Momentum

When you gain momentum, you may do one of the following actions:

1. Draw a card.
2. Play a research card.
3. Play an innovation card.

_Note: Mad Science cards have no strategy associated with them, so you cannot gain momentum from a Mad Science card._

---

### Advancing Mad Science

When you advance Mad Science, do the following:

1. If the "1 ✓ end" indicator is showing, add one Mad Science die to the Mad Science dice pool if possible. If you have no more Mad Science
   dice left to add, then do nothing.
2. If the "1 x continue" indicator is showing, remove a Mad Science die from the Mad Science dice pool. Then if there is only one die in the
   Mad Science dice pool, change the "1 x continue" indicator to the "1 ✓ end" indicator by clicking on it.

### Game Materials

This game can be played physically using the following materials:

- 3 decks of regular playing cards
- 14 even-sided dice for Mad Science dice (designate half the sides as positive and half as negative)
- 1 six-sided die for the Acceleration Risk die

Designate one suit of cards for each of the four strategies. Separate the cards into suits for one deck to use as the strategy cards, and
shuffle the other two decks together to form the Science deck. The face cards should be treated as Research cards and the numbered cards
should be treated as Innovation cards. The numbered cards that with a value less than 6 are treated as having an acceleration risk
proportional to their value. Be sure all the jokers are shuffled into the Science deck, these are treated as Mad Science cards.
