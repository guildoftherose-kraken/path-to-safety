# Welcome to Untitled AI Game!

You are a community of researchers racing to develop a strong AI alignment strategy before super-intelligent AI is developed. Work together to save humanity!

# Game Objective

There are four strategies, "Governance", "Agent Foundations", "Pivotal Act", and "Prosaic YOLO Shard". Each of these strategies has a hidden difficulty between 1 and 13. You need your progress in one or more of the strategies to be higher than its difficulty at the end of the game to win. You can research the strategies to get more information about the difficulty of the strategy, publish papers to increase your progress in that strategy, and collaborate with others to give everyone a boost in their research. However, at the end of each round, you will need to roll the Mad Science dice, which will end the game if you get a bad roll! You will need to work together to be able to complete a strategy before time runs out!

# Game Flow

Have all players join the room and then click the "Reset Game" button to start a new game. Each player will take a turn in numerical order, and then the round will end and a new round will start. Keep playing rounds until the game ends.

# On Your Turn

First, draw a card (See "When You Draw a Card"). Then take one of the following actions:

*Research:* Play a research card (See "When You Play a Research Card"). If the strategy of the research card you played matches the strategy of the card beneath it in the discard pile, then gain momentum (See "When You Gain Momentum").
*Publish:* Play an innovation card (See "When You Play an Innovation Card"). If the strategy of the innovation card you played matches the strategy of the card beneath it in the discard pile, then gain momentum (See "When You Gain Momentum").
*Collaborate:* Discard a card from your hand, and all other players draw a card.

# At the End of the Round
First, advance Mad Science (See "When You Advance Mad Science"). Then roll all of the Mad Science dice. If the "1 x continue" indicator is showing and none of the dice are showing the "x" symbol, the game ends (See "When The Game Ends"). If the "1 ✓ end" indicator is showing and any of the dice are showing the "✓" symbol, the game ends (See "When The Game Ends").

# When You Draw a Card
When you draw a card, reveal the top card of the Science deck. If it is a Mad Science card, immediately discard that card and advance Mad Science (See "When You Advance Mad Science"). Otherwise, put that card into your hand. Repeat this process until you have added a non-Mad-Science card to your hand.

# When You Play a Research Card
When you play a research card, discard it from your hand into the Science discard pile. Then reveal the top card of the strategy deck indicated by the research card you discarded, moving the revealed strategy card to the appropriate revealed cards zone. Then roll the Dual Use die. If the number shown on the Dual Use die is lower than the Risk value shown on the card, advance Mad Science. (You don't actually need to roll the die if the Risk level is zero since it is impossible for this to advance Mad Science)

# When You Play an Innovation Card
When you play an innovation card, discard it from your hand into the Science discard pile. Then increase your progress level by one in the strategy indicated by the card.

# When You Gain Momentum
When you gain momentum, you may do one of the following actions:
1. Draw a card
2. Play a research card
3. Play an innovation card

# When You Advance Mad Science
When you advance Mad Science, do the following:
1. If the "1 ✓ end" indicator is showing, add one Mad Science die to the Mad Science dice pool if possible. If you have no more Mad Science dice left to add, then do nothing.
2. If the "1 x continue" indicator is showing, remove a Mad Science die from the Mad Science dice pool. Then if there is only one die in the Mad Science dice pool, change the "1 x continue" indicator to the "1 ✓ end" indicator by clicking on it.
